#Mikes Portfolis
this is the hw for week 2

This is a basic portfolio designed to highlight the first couple projects I have created. The focus for this was getting familiar with Advanced-CSS and pushing myself to get creative and try new things. I had a lot of challenges working with the pseudo elements and getting them to work properly.

There are a few links inside this web program. If you click on the hightlighted buttons or the highlighted buttons, they will direct you to a link that opens into a new tab.
